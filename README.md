Introduction
------------

`CmplxRoots.jl` is a library for finding roots of complex polynomials, written
in [Julia](http://julialang.org/).

This is an implementation in Julia of the
[General Complex Polynomial Root Solver](http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/~jskowron/cmplx_roots_sg/),
written in Fortran, by **Jan Skowron** and **Andy Gould**.  All the credits goes
to them for the original algorithm.  Feel free to report bugs and make
suggestions at https://github.com/giordano/CmplxRoots.jl/issues.

The root finding algorithm employed in this library is described in

* J. Skowron & A. Gould, 2012, "General Complex Polynomial Root Solver and Its
  Further Optimization for Binary Microlenses",
  [arXiv:1203.1034](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1034)

This algorithm aims to be fast and precise, more than the well known `zroots`
procedure described in *Numerical Recipes* books, whose implementations in C and
Fortran are not available as free software, according to the
[definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) of the Free Software
Foundation.

Installation
------------

`CmplxRoots.jl` is available for Julia 0.4 and later versions, and can be installed
with
[Julia built-in package manager](http://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/packages/).
In a Julia session run the command

```julia
julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/giordano/CmplxRoots.jl.git")
```

<!-- You may need to update your package list with `Pkg.update()` in order to get the -->
<!-- latest version of `CmplxRoots.jl`. -->

Usage
-----

After installing the package, run

``` julia
using CmplxRoots
```

or put this command into your Julia script.

`CmplxRoots.jl` provides two functions to find the roots of complex polynomials

``` julia
roots(polynomial[, roots, polish=true])
roots5(polynomial[, roots])
```

`roots` can be used to solve polynomials of any degree, `roots5` is tailored to
(and works only for) polynomials of degree 5.  This function exists because
[one of the methods](http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/309566) to calculate
[gravitational microlensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_microlensing)
amplification by a binary lens requires solving a fifth-order complex
polynomial.  `roots5` should be more robust than `roots` for this class of
polynomials.

The mandatory argument for both functions is:

* `polynomial`, the vector holding coefficients of the polynomial you want to
  solve, in ascending order, from the lowest to the highest.  Coefficients can
  be complex and real

Optional arguments are:

* `roots`: if you roughly know in advance the position of the roots, you can
  pass the vector with the known roots to speed up convergence.  `roots` vector
  must be one element shorther than `polynomial`.  In `roots5`, the roots will
  be only polished.  Elements of the vector can be complex and real
* `polish` (boolean keyword, only for `roots`): if set to `true`, after all
  roots have been found by dividing original polynomial by each root found, all
  roots will be polished using full polynomial.  Default is `false`

The functions return in output the `Complex128` vector with all roots of
`polynomial`.  **Note:** if `roots` optional argument is provided, it is *not*
changed in-place.

Example
-------

Find the roots of

```
(x - i)*(x - 2)*(x - 3*i)*(x - 4)*(x - 5*i) =
  x^5 - (9*i + 6)*x^4 + (54*i - 15)*x^3 + (138 - 57*i)*x^2 - (184 + 90*i)*x + 120*i
```

This is a fifth-order polynomial, so we can find its zeros with both `roots` and
`roots5`:

``` julia
julia> roots([120im, -(184 + 90im), (138 - 57im), (54im - 15), -(6 + 9im), 1])
5-element Array{Complex{Float64},1}:
         -0.0+5.0im
 4.0-8.88178e-16im
  8.29305e-17+3.0im
 2.0+1.88202e-16im
 -2.95544e-17+1.0im

julia> roots5([120im, -(184 + 90im), (138 - 57im), (54im - 15), -(6 + 9im), 1])
5-element Array{Complex{Float64},1}:
  5.92119e-16+5.0im
  4.0-1.4803e-16im
 2.0+1.88202e-16im
 -1.88738e-15+3.0im
  2.10942e-15+1.0im
```

`CmplxRoots.jl` handles polynomials with high-multiplicity roots as well.  For
example, consider

```
(x - 1)^5 = x^5 - 5x^4 + 10x^3 - 10x^2 + 5x -1
```

You can find its roots with

``` julia
julia> roots([1, -5, 10, -10, 5, -1])
5-element Array{Complex{Float64},1}:
 1.0-0.0im
 1.0+0.0im
 1.0+0.0im
 1.0+0.0im
 1.0+0.0im

julia> roots5([1, -5, 10, -10, 5, -1])
5-element Array{Complex{Float64},1}:
 1.0+0.0im
 1.0+0.0im
 1.0+0.0im
 1.0+0.0im
 1.0-0.0im
```

Related projects
----------------

Another Julia package for finding roots of complex polynomials is
[`Polynomials.jl`](https://github.com/Keno/Polynomials.jl), by Jameson Nash and
other contributors.  This package does much more than finding roots of
polynomials (among other features, it can integrate and differentiate
polynomials).  In order to solve the polynomial, `Polynomials.jl` calculates
eigenvalues of its companion matrix, but `CmplxRoots.jl` is usually faster by up
to an order of magnitude and often slightly more precise.  If you are after
speed and precision, `CmplxRoots.jl` can still be a better option.
